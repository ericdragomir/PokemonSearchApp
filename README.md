# PokemonSearchApp
A simple search app that uses the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) for retrieving information and fetching the data.

You can try this app [here](https://ericdragomir.github.io/PokemonSearchApp/)

## Installation
  1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
  2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage
In this web app, we can select the Pokemon by using the Pokemon's name or its ID, after that, we can select the skin type (Normal/Default or Shiny) and the gender, although this is not supported for all Pokemon. When a pokemon is selected, a sprite will be provided of the front and back if posible (some pokemon don't have a back sprite), its types and its stats.

## How it works
For selecting the Pokemon, you have to use a text-based input for typing the name or ID of the Pokemon but for selecting the skin type or the gender you will have to use the dropdown provided, on top of each one of the inputs (both text-based and dropdowns) you will find a label pointing at them and explaining why are there for.
